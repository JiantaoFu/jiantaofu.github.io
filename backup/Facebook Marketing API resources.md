If you want to manage the Facebook Ads with API, you should check the marketing API. I'm thinking about build MCP server for facebook ads management.

The [document](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/) is not friendly for the new comers, especially the auth token setup, there is no screenshot, and outdated, and both the doc and the pages are messy with lots of stuffs there. Luckily I found this YouTube video "[Facebook Graph API: A Full Guide for Marketers and Non-Techies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFM3Otvb7So)" very helpful. 

And checkout [Facebook API Tutorial: Graph API, Access Token and Developer Documentation Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4uTxSNo6Q)

Once you watched the videos, you can check https://www.postman.com/meta/facebook-marketing-api/overview and play with it.

And auotmation with make, check video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjzUlHcuUtA,  you can download the template at https://neilstephenson.beehiiv.com/p/video-tutorial-automated-facebook-ads-creative-testing.

Another related is [ads library API](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/), but it's not used to manage your Ads, it's providing your Ads stats, as you can see https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report, and do some search at https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/.
